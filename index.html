		<p style="text-indent:1.5cm">Liverpool F.C. was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After
	eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.  Originally named "Everton
	F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months 
	later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.  The team won the Lancashire League in its début season, and joined the 
	Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893–94 season. After finishing in first place the club was promoted to the First Division, which it 
	won in 1901 and again in 1906. Liverpool reached its first FA Cup Final in 1914, losing 1–0 to Burnley. It won consecutive League championships in 1922 
	and 1923, but did not win another trophy until the 1946–47 season, when the club won the First Division for a fifth time under the control of ex-West Ham 
	Utd centre half George Kay.  Liverpool suffered its second Cup Final defeat in 1950, playing against Arsenal. To find out more about Liverpool FC first team click <a href="team.html">here.</a>

		<p style="text-indent:1.5cm">In the 2009–10 season, Liverpool finished seventh in the Premier League and failed to qualify for the Champions League. Benítez subsequently left by
	mutual consent  and was replaced by Fulham manager Roy Hodgson.  At the start of the 2010–11 season Liverpool was on the verge of bankruptcy and the club's
	creditors asked the High Court to allow the sale of the club, overruling the wishes of Hicks and Gillett. John W. Henry, owner of the Boston Red Sox and
	of Fenway Sports Group, bid successfully for the club and took ownership in October 2010. Poor results during the start of that season led to Hodgson 
	leaving the club by mutual consent and former player & manager Kenny Dalglish taking over.  Despite a record 8th League Cup success against Cardiff and an 
	FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea, Liverpool finished in eighth position in the 2011–12 season, the worst league finish in 18 years and led to the sacking of
	Dalglish. To see Barcley Premier League table click <a href="match_table.html">here.</a>

		<p style="text-indent:1.5cm">Liverpool won both the League and the UEFA Cup during the 1972–73 season, and the FA Cup again a year later. Shankly retired soon afterwards and was
	replaced by his assistant, Bob Paisley.  In 1976, Paisley's second season as manager, the club won another League and UEFA Cup double. The following season,
	the club retained the League title and won the European Cup for the first time, but it lost in the 1977 FA Cup Final. Liverpool retained the European Cup 
	in 1978 and regained the First Division title in 1979. During Paisley's nine seasons as manager Liverpool won 21 trophies, including three European Cups,
	a UEFA Cup, six League titles and three consecutive League Cups; the only domestic trophy he did not win was the FA Cup. Paisley retired in 1983 and was 
	replaced by his assistant, Joe Fagan. Liverpool won the League, League Cup and European Cup in Fagan's first season, becoming the first English side to win
	three trophies in a season.  Liverpool reached the European Cup final again in 1985, against Juventus at the Heysel Stadium. Before kick-off, Liverpool 
	fans breached a fence which separated the two groups of supporters, and charged the Juventus fans. The resulting weight of people caused a retaining wall 
	to collapse, killing 39 fans, mostly Italians. The incident became known as the Heysel Stadium disaster. The match was played in spite of protests by both 
	managers, and Liverpool lost 1–0 to Juventus. To read more about Liverpool FC history click <a href="history.html">here.</a>

		<p style="text-indent:1.5cm">The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989.
	Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the 
	following days The Sun newspaper published an article entitled "The Truth", in which it claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated 
	on and attacked the police. Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the 
	city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy The Sun more than 20 years later. Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as
	the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice. Liverpool's 
	longest-established rivalry is with fellow Merseyside team Everton, against whom the club contest the Merseyside derby. To read more about Liverpool FC fans click <a href="fans.html">here.</a>
