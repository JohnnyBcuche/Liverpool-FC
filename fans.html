	provide a valuable service to loyal Liverpool Football Club supporters living in the local area. The Supporters Clubs also provide an excellent way of
	meeting fellow supporters who are devoted to following Liverpool Football Club, wherever they live in the World. Official Supporter Clubs are closely 
	affiliated to Liverpool Football Club and enjoy a close working relationship with the Club. If you would like to contact your local Supporters Club,

	recognised Club of the LFC Official Supporters Clubs in at least 50 countries. Notable groups include Spirit of Shankly and Reclaim The Kop. The club 
	takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Liverpool fans often refer to themselves as Kopites, a reference to the fans who once
	stood, and now sit, on the Kop at Anfield. In 2008 a group of fans decided to form a splinter club, A.F.C. Liverpool, to play matches for fans who had 
	been priced out of watching Premier League football.

    <p class="p1">The club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, in which 39 Juventus supporters were 
	killed. They were confined to a corner by Liverpool fans who had charged in their direction; the weight of the cornered fans caused a wall to collapse.
	UEFA laid the blame for the incident solely on the Liverpool supporters, and banned all English clubs from European competition for five years. Liverpool 
	was banned for an additional year, preventing it from participating in the 1990â€“91 European Cup, even though it won the League in 1990. Twenty-seven fans 
	were arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and were extradited to Belgium in 1987 to face trial. In 1989, after a five-month trial in Belgium, 14 Liverpool
	fans were given three-year sentences for involuntary manslaughter; half of the terms were suspended. The song "You'll Never Walk Alone", originally from 
	the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical Carousel and later recorded by Liverpool musicians Gerry & The Pacemakers, is the club's anthem and has been sung by
	the Anfield crowd since the early 1960s. It has since gained popularity among fans of other clubs around the world. The song's title adorns the top of the
	Shankly Gates, which were unveiled on 2 August 1982 in memory of former manager Bill Shankly. The "You'll Never Walk Alone" portion of the Shankly Gates is
	also reproduced on the club's crest. The club's supporters have been involved in two stadium disasters. The first was the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster,

	<p class="p1">The second disaster took place during an FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, on 15 April 1989.
	Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a consequence of overcrowding at the Leppings Lane end, in what became known as the Hillsborough disaster. In the 
	following days The Sun newspaper published an article entitled "The Truth", in which it claimed that Liverpool fans had robbed the dead and had urinated 
	on and attacked the police. Subsequent investigations proved the allegations false, leading to a boycott of the newspaper by Liverpool fans across the 
	city and elsewhere; many still refuse to buy The Sun more than 20 years later. Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as
	the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice. Liverpool's 
	longest-established rivalry is with fellow Merseyside team Everton, against whom the club contest the Merseyside derby. Their rivalry stems from Liverpool's
	formation and the dispute with Everton officials and the then owners of Anfield. Unlike other rivalries, there is no political, geographical or religious 
	split between Liverpool and Everton. The Merseyside derby is usually sold out. It is one of the few local derbies which do not enforce fan segregation, and
	hence was known as the "friendly derby". Since the mid-1980s, the rivalry has intensified both on and off the field and, since the inception of the Premier
	League in 1992, the Merseyside derby has had more players sent off than any other Premier League game.  Many support organisations were set up in the wake of the disaster, such as
	the Hillsborough Justice Campaign, which represents bereaved families, survivors and supporters in their efforts to secure justice.
